Probably my all time favorite mushroom side to make with steak. After cooking the mushrooms for a couple minutes, the butter had been quickly absorbed and the pan was dry. So we added a bit of chicken stock, then the seasonings and put the lid on for a couple minutes. Place the pieces of round steak evenly around the pan. Cut onion into slices and place them evenly on top of the meat.
