Tips to make ultra crispy smashed potatoes. Ultra Crispy Smashed Potatoes are straight forward to make - boil, squish, drizzle, bake - but there are two little tips I&#39;ve discovered along the way: Let the potatoes steam dry a bit after smashing them. Use butter and a touch of oil. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to a good simmer, and cook the potatoes until they are completely tender and can be easily pierced with a metal or wooden skewer. Arrange potatoes on baking sheet and lightly crush each potato with the heel of your hand until potatoes are about Â½ inch thick.
