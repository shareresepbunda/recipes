Many people make this recipe with flour, but I&#39;ve used Panko breadcrumbs here to mix it up and make &#39;em extra crunchy. While oil is heating, whisk batter once more, then add morels, turning them with a fork to coat. Working with one at a time, lift morels from batter, allowing any excess batter to drain off, then carefully lower into oil. Working in small batches, fry morels, turning frequently, until golden and crisp all over. Fried morels can be done in several ways, but I prefer this method.
