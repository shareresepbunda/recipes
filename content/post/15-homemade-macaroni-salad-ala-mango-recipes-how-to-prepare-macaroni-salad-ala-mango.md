I was hesitant about posting this recipe - it&#39;s the macaroni salad I grew up with, and pretty basic. Tuna macaroni salad holds a special place in my heart. It reminds me of big summertime cookouts and family reunions in Elberton. I&#39;m surprised to hear a lot of folks have never had tuna macaroni salad before. Maybe it&#39;s more of a southern thing because I grew up on this stuff.
